# Ocean_temperaturenalaysis
This file contains the average ocean temperature using time-series data analysis. 
For that we downloaded the temperature files for all the years from 2000 onwards to predict the average future weather using the the ARIMA model. We found that after using that model. For that we divide the total data into training and testing part. After implementing that, we found that after using that we are able to predict the future average temperature which exactly match with the actual temperature.
